775. Global and Local Inversions
https://leetcode.com/problems/global-and-local-inversions/

We have some permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N - 1], where N is the length of A.

The number of (global) inversions is the number of i < j with 0 <= i < j < N and A[i] > A[j].

The number of local inversions is the number of i with 0 <= i < N and A[i] > A[i+1].

Return true if and only if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,0,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is 1 global inversion, and 1 local inversion.

Example 2:

Input: A = [1,2,0]
Output: false
Explanation: There are 2 global inversions, and 1 local inversion.
Note:

A will be a permutation of [0, 1, ..., A.length - 1].
A will have length in range [1, 5000].
The time limit for this problem has been reduced.

class Solution:
    def isIdealPermutation(self, A: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Local inversion belongs to Global inversion
        # So if true, all local should be global
        return all(abs(i - e) <= 1 for i, e in enumerate(A))
