344. Reverse String
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

Write a function that reverses a string.
The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.


Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Constraints:
    1 <= s.length <= 105
    s[i] is a printable ascii character.

        for i in range(len(s) >> 1):
            s[i], s[len(s)-i-1] = s[len(s)-i-1], s[i]
